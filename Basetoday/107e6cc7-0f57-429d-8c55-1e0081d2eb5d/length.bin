Pursuant to Cheniere’s comprehensive capital allocation plan, Cheniere deployed over $1.3 billion towards accretive growth, balance sheet management and shareholder returns in the first quarter of 2025. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, Cheniere repurchased an aggregate of approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock for approximately $350 million, repaid $300 million of consolidated long-term indebtedness and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.500 per share of common stock, totaling approximately $112 million.

In April 2025, Cheniere declared a dividend with respect to the first quarter 2025 of $0.500 per share of common stock, which is payable on May 19, 2025.

In March 2025, Cheniere announced that Substantial Completion of the first train (“Train 1”) of the CCL Stage 3 Project (defined below) was achieved on March 16, 2025.

In March 2025, the CCL Midscale Trains 8 & 9 Project (defined below) received authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) to site, construct and operate the project. We anticipate receiving all remaining necessary regulatory approvals in order to make Final Investment Decision (“FID”) on the project in 2025.

CEO COMMENT

“2025 is off to an outstanding start thanks to the Cheniere team’s commitment to excellence across our operations, project execution and financial discipline. The quarter was highlighted by the achievement of Substantial Completion on Train 1 of the Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project, and the production and shipment of our 4,000th LNG cargo to-date,” said Jack Fusco, Cheniere’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Progress on Stage 3 continues to advance on an accelerated schedule, reinforcing our confidence in having the first three trains operational by the end of 2025. Looking ahead, our focus for 2025 will remain on the safe and reliable delivery of our LNG to our customers worldwide, advancing our project developments at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi, delivering meaningful shareholder returns, and generating full year Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow within our guidance ranges.”

SUMMARY AND REVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS

(in millions, except LNG data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 2024 % Change Revenues $ 5,444 $ 4,253 28 % Net income1 $ 353 $ 502 (30 )% Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA2 $ 1,872 $ 1,773 6 % LNG exported: Number of cargoes 168 166 1 % Volumes (TBtu) 609 602 1 % LNG volumes loaded (TBtu) 608 601 1 %

Net income1 decreased approximately $149 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the corresponding 2024 period. The decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $277 million of unfavorable variances related to changes in fair value of our derivative instruments, including the impact of derivative instruments related to our long-term Integrated Production Marketing (“IPM”) agreements (before tax and non-controlling interests) for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the corresponding 2024 period.

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA2 increased approximately $99 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the corresponding 2024 period. The increase was primarily due to higher total margins per MMBtu of liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) delivered during the 2025 period as compared to the corresponding 2024 period.

Share-based compensation expenses included in net income totaled $56 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to $40 million for the corresponding 2024 period.

Our financial results are reported on a consolidated basis. Our ownership interest in Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (“Cheniere Partners”) (NYSE: CQP) as of March 31, 2025 consisted of 100% ownership of the general partner and a 48.6% limited partner interest.

LIQUEFACTION PROJECTS OVERVIEW

SPL Project

Through Cheniere Partners, we operate liquefaction and export facilities with a total production capacity of approximately 30 million tonnes per annum (“mtpa”) of LNG at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Cameron Parish, Louisiana (the “SPL Project”).

SPL Expansion Project

Through Cheniere Partners, we are developing an expansion adjacent to the SPL Project with an expected total production capacity of up to approximately 20 mtpa of LNG (the “SPL Expansion Project”), inclusive of estimated debottlenecking opportunities. In February 2024, certain subsidiaries of Cheniere Partners submitted an application to the FERC for authorization to site, construct and operate the SPL Expansion Project, as well as an application to the Department of Energy (“DOE”) requesting authorization to export LNG to Free-Trade Agreement (“FTA”) and non-FTA countries, both of which applications exclude debottlenecking. In October 2024, we received authorization from the DOE to export LNG to FTA countries.

CCL Project

We operate liquefaction and export facilities with a total production capacity of over 16 mtpa of LNG at the Corpus Christi LNG terminal near Corpus Christi, Texas (the “CCL Project”), inclusive of Train 1 of the CCL Stage 3 Project.

CCL Stage 3 Project

We are constructing an expansion adjacent to the CCL Project consisting of seven midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of over 10 mtpa of LNG (the “CCL Stage 3 Project”). Substantial Completion was achieved for the first train of the CCL Stage 3 Project in March 2025.

CCL Stage 3 Project Progress as of March 31, 2025:

CCL Stage 3 Project Project Status Under Construction / Commissioning Project Completion Percentage 82.5%(1) Expected Substantial Completion 1H 2025 - 2H 2026 (1) Engineering 98.2% complete, procurement 99.8% complete, subcontract work 89.8% complete and construction 53.7% complete.

CCL Midscale Trains 8 & 9 Project

We are developing two additional midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of approximately 3 mtpa of LNG (the “CCL Midscale Trains 8 & 9 Project”) adjacent to the CCL Stage 3 Project. In March 2023, certain of our subsidiaries filed an application with the FERC for authorization to site, construct and operate the CCL Midscale Trains 8 & 9 Project, and in April 2023, filed an application with the DOE requesting authorization to export LNG to FTA and non-FTA countries. In July 2023, we received authorization from the DOE to export LNG to FTA countries. In March 2025, we received authorization from the FERC to site, construct and operate the CCL Midscale Trains 8 & 9 Project and anticipate receiving all remaining necessary regulatory approvals in order to FID the project in 2025.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Regulation G Reconciliations Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA The following table reconciles our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to U.S. GAAP results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 2024 Net income attributable to Cheniere $ 353 $ 502 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 315 337 Income tax provision 121 109 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest 229 266 Interest and dividend income (37 ) (61 ) Other expense (income), net (20 ) 1 Income from operations $ 961 $ 1,154 Adjustments to reconcile income from operations to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 312 302 Loss from changes in fair value of commodity and foreign exchange (“FX”) derivatives, net (1) 562 285 Total non-cash compensation expense 37 32 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,872 $ 1,773

____________________ (1) Change in fair value of commodity and FX derivatives prior to contractual delivery or termination

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and external users of our Consolidated Financial Statements to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structures, or historical cost basis. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

We believe Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA provides relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operating performance in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of financial and operating performance.

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking net income attributable to Cheniere before net income attributable to non-controlling interests, interest expense, net of capitalized interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, and adjusting for the effects of certain non-cash items, other non-operating income or expense items, and other items not otherwise predictive or indicative of ongoing operating performance, including the effects of modification or extinguishment of debt, impairment expense, gain or loss on disposal of assets, changes in the fair value of our commodity and FX derivatives prior to contractual delivery or termination, and non-cash compensation expense. The change in fair value of commodity and FX derivatives is considered in determining Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA given that the timing of recognizing gains and losses on these derivative contracts differs from the recognition of the related item economically hedged. We believe the exclusion of these items enables investors and other users of our financial information to assess our sequential and year-over-year performance and operating trends on a more comparable basis and is consistent with management’s own evaluation of performance.

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow

The following table reconciles our actual Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow to Net income attributable to Cheniere for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and forecast amounts for full year 2025 (in billions):

Three Months Ended March 31, Full Year 2025 2025 Net income attributable to Cheniere $ 0.35 $ 2.5 - $ 2.9 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 0.32 1.1 - 1.1 Income tax provision 0.12 0.6 - 0.7 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest 0.23 1.0 - 1.0 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 0.31 1.3 - 1.3 Other income, financing costs, and certain non-cash operating expenses 0.54 0.1 - 0.1 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $ 1.87 $ 6.5 - $ 7.0 Interest expense (net of capitalized interest and amortization) (0.21 ) (0.9 ) - (0.9 ) Maintenance capital expenditures (0.03 ) (0.2 ) - (0.2 ) Income tax (excludes deferred taxes)(1) (0.09 ) (0.3 ) - (0.3 ) Other income 0.02 0.0 - 0.0 Consolidated Distributable Cash Flow $ 1.56 $ 5.1 - $ 5.7 Distributable Cash Flow attributable to non-controlling interests (0.28 ) (1.0 ) - (1.1 ) Cheniere Distributable Cash Flow $ 1.27 $ 4.1 - $ 4.6

____________________ Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. (1) Our cash tax payments are subject to commodity and market volatility, regulatory changes and other factors which could significantly impact both the timing and amount of our future cash tax payments. Our 2025 full year Distributable Cash Flow guidance does not consider any prospective changes to local, domestic or international tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those related to the corporate alternative minimum tax or prospective tax reform. Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to such risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those set forth in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part 1 or as disclosed under Operating Cash Flows in Sources and Uses of Cash within Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Cheniere Energy, Inc. Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Distributable Cash Flow is defined as cash generated from the operations of Cheniere and its subsidiaries and adjusted for non-controlling interests. The Distributable Cash Flow of Cheniere’s subsidiaries is calculated by taking the subsidiaries’ EBITDA less interest expense, net of capitalized interest, taxes, maintenance capital expenditures and other non-operating income or expense items, and adjusting for the effect of certain non-cash items and other items not otherwise predictive or indicative of ongoing operating performance, including the effects of modification or extinguishment of debt, amortization of debt issue costs, premiums or discounts, impairment of equity method investment and deferred taxes. Cheniere’s Distributable Cash Flow includes 100% of the Distributable Cash Flow of Cheniere’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. For subsidiaries with non-controlling investors, our share of Distributable Cash Flow is calculated as the Distributable Cash Flow of the subsidiary reduced by the economic interest of the non-controlling investors as if 100% of the Distributable Cash Flow were distributed in order to reflect our ownership interests and our incentive distribution rights, if applicable. The Distributable Cash Flow attributable to non-controlling interests is calculated in the same method as Distributions to non-controlling interests as presented on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) in our Forms 10-Q and Forms 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This amount may differ from the actual distributions paid to non-controlling investors by the subsidiary for a particular period.

We believe Distributable Cash Flow is a useful performance measure for management, investors and other users of our financial information to evaluate our performance and to measure and estimate the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt, paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital, that could be considered for deployment by our Board of Directors pursuant to our capital allocation plan, such as by way of common stock dividends, stock repurchases, retirement of debt, or expansion capital expenditures1. Distributable Cash Flow is not intended to represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

1 Capital spending for our business consists primarily of:

Maintenance capital expenditures. These expenditures include costs which qualify for capitalization that are required to sustain property, plant and equipment reliability and safety and to address environmental or other regulatory requirements rather than to generate incremental distributable cash flow; and

Expansion capital expenditures. These expenditures are undertaken primarily to generate incremental distributable cash flow and include investment in accretive organic growth, acquisition or construction of additional complementary assets to grow our business, along with expenditures to enhance the productivity and efficiency of our existing facilities.
